# Delhi Bus Travel Application README

## Overview

This mobile application prototype is designed to improve the experience of traveling by Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster scheme buses.

## Problem Statement

- Over 30 lakh people, approximately 14% of Delhi's population, traveled by DTC and cluster scheme buses daily as of February 2022.
- There is currently no comprehensive mobile application that provides clear routes for various bus numbers.
- Passengers waiting for a DTC bus often face uncertainty about the exact location and timing of the next bus due to traffic conditions.

## Personal Experience

- We have frequently used DTC buses for commuting to our coaching institutes and understand the frustration of waiting for buses without knowing their arrival times.
- This inspired us to develop a mobile application prototype to help users check bus timings, find the right bus numbers, and book tickets online.

## Features

1. **Personalized User Experience:**
   - Quick signup/login process for personalized usage.
   - Live location tracking to find the nearest bus stand.

2. **Route and Timing Information:**
   - Input destination to receive the shortest route and relevant bus numbers.
   - Accurate timings of upcoming buses using live GPS data from buses.

3. **Ticket Booking:**
   - Online ticket purchasing through a UPI-based payment gateway.
   - Eliminates the need to gather around conductors for tickets, reducing crowding.

## User Base

1. **Students:**
   - A significant user group as many students use DTC buses for daily commute to schools and colleges.

2. **Office Workers:**
   - Regular commuters to offices represent another major user group.

3. **Women:**
   - Women, who can travel free on DTC buses in Delhi, are a key user base.

4. **Senior Citizens:**
   - The app facilitates easy ticket booking, helping senior citizens avoid crowded interactions with conductors.

5. **Tourists:**
   - Tourists unfamiliar with Delhi's bus system can use the app to navigate the city efficiently at nominal fares.

## Development Process

- Requirement gathering, empathy mapping, user personas, and surveys were conducted.
- Prototyping involved both low-fidelity (lo-fi) and high-fidelity (hi-fi) designs on Figma to refine the user experience.

## Conclusion

We believe that through a thorough application prototype of interaction design principles, this app will provide a simple, effective, and user-friendly solution to the challenges faced by DTC bus commuters in Delhi.
